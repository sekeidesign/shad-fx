The Dither FX library in `components/dither-fx/` began from dither-kit's
ordered-dither rendering and is derived from it in these respects:

- Drawing into a low-resolution backing canvas and scaling it up with
  `image-rendering: pixelated`, sized as the CSS box divided by a cell size and
  capped to a maximum grid.
- The `BAYER4` 4×4 ordered-dither threshold matrix, normalised to 0–1 as
  `(v + 0.5) / 16`.
- Painting every cell at one of two alpha tiers of the same colour instead of
  leaving a hole where the cell does not clear the threshold.

The effects themselves (fire, bolt, rings, fluid, beam), the `Painter` blitting
through a single `ImageData`, the frame loop with its eased intensity and idle
parking, and the reduced-motion handling are not from dither-kit.

dither-kit declares `"license": "MIT"` in its package.json files. As of this
writing it ships no LICENSE file and no copyright line, so there is no upstream
notice to reproduce verbatim. The MIT terms it declares are reproduced below,
with copyright attributed to its stated owner. This notice will be corrected to
match once an upstream LICENSE exists.
